# Analysis Summaries - Please read me!

The following repo contains two summaries:

- an Analysis 1 summary for the spring 2019 analysis 1 lecture taught by Prof. Burger
- an Analysis 2 summary for the fall 2019 analysis 2 lecture taught by Prof. Kowalski

I will continue to fix bugs over the course of the next months, hence things might still change.

## Important Notice:

**Do not use this as your exam summary - feel free to take my source code and apply a different design as well as add and remove some parts or copy parts out of my summary, but as far as I know the summaries must be self-written (can also be digital) and I wouldn't wanna get problems if they check on exam day that everyone has their own summary).**

## Compiling

This summary requires a ton of packages. It works on a complete Texlive distribution on linux as well as Miktex on Windows (it will automatically download missing packages in the background, so the first time you compile it might take a while). Alternatively you can also just copy the whole repo into an Overleaf project and use their online compiler.

## I found a mistake? What do I do?

Excellent. Please be so kind and clone this project and add the fix yourself, this way we can directly update the summary in this repo. If you don't feel like doing that or can't do that feel free to send me an email at zdavid@student.ethz.ch
